# Angular 2 QuickStart Source

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Discard everything "git-like" by deleting the `.git` folder.
```bash
rm -rf .git
```

### Create a new git repo
You could [start writing code](#start-development) now and throw it all away when you're done.
If you'd rather preserve your work under source control, consider taking the following steps.

Initialize this project as a *local git repo* and make the first commit:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a *remote repository* for this project on the service of your choice.

Grab its address (e.g. *`https://github.com/<my-org>/my-proj.git`*) and push the *local repo* to the *remote*.
```bash
git remote add origin <repo-address>
git push -u origin master
```
### Start development

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
gulp serve
```
You're ready to write your application.

Remember the npm scripts in `package.json`:

* `gulp serve` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `gulp scripts` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `gulp tslint` - lints all custom TypeScript files.
* `gulp sass` - runs the Sass compiler once.
* `gulp sass-lint` - lints all Sass/Scss files
